Their experiments introduced the scientific community to genes, DNA (deoxyribonucleic acids), and the double helix structure of DNA strings (Figure. 1)	</p>		<br>		<center>	<div class="screenshot">		<img src="../gfx/dna.gif"><br>		<p>Figure 1. A molecular model of DNA</p>	<div>	</center>		<br>		<p class="main-text">		Gregor Mendel is often considered to be the founding father of genetics. He began research that led to understanding the building blocks of life and how to alter them. 		In the early 1970's, Frederick Sanger and his colleagues recognized these building blocks to be DNA and then coded proteins		 of DNA. As a result of this research, scientists eventually developed a method to sequence DNA. 		Scientists were now on their way to understanding more about DNA, and what roll the gene plays in deciding the attributes of 		organisms.	</p>		<br>		<span class="section-header"><a name="conventional" id="conventional"><font color="#FF71A5">Conventional Sequencing Method</font></a></span>	<br>		<p class="main-text">		In early 1974, Frederick Sanger was first accredited with the invention of DNA sequencing techniques. 		During experiments to uncover the amino acids in the insulin protein, he developed the basics of modern sequencing methods.		 Almost simultaneously, the American scientists Alan Maxam and Walter Gilbert were creating a somewhat different method		  called the cleavage method. But their way showed less promise and as a result it was soon forgotten by the scientific community.	</p>	<p class="main-text">		Sanger's approach involved copying DNA strands with dNTP (deoxyribonucleic acid triphosphates) and terminating them 		with tagged ddNTPs (dideoxyribonucleic acid triphosphates), which would show the location of the nucleotides in the		 strands though the use of X-Ray machines. This technique is very slow and tedious, usually taking many years to sequence 		 only a few million letters in a string of DNA that often contain hundreds of millions or even billions of letters. 		 However, because of this process's accepted accuracy and the lack of new techniques, many researchers still use a similar		  method today.	</p>	<br>		<center>	<div class="screenshot">		<img src="../gfx/sangers.gif"><br>		<p>Figure 2: Sangers sequencing method.</p>	<div>	</center>		<br>			<span class="section-header"><a name="modern" id="modern"><font color="#FF71A5">Modern Techniques</font></a></span>	<br>		<p class="main-text">		Modern techniques differ because scientists no longer use x-rays to detect the DNA letters. This is because this process is 		very slow. Scientists had to analyze the composite collections of DNA pieces detected by the X-Rays from four test tubes, 		one for each of the nucleotides found in DNA (Adenosine, Cytosine, Thimidine, Guanine). Then they needed to be arranged in 		the correct order. About ten years ago, scientists discovered a means of detecting the ddNTPs with fluorescent tags, which 		required only a single test tube instead of four. As a result of this discovery, the time required to process a given batch of 		DNA was reduced by one fourth. This breakthrough recently sparked a feud between the National Institute of Health and 		other organizations who use the Sanger fluorescent method, and Craig Venter, whose innovative ideas created the fastest 		and possibly most accurate methods for DNA sequencing.	</p>	<br>		<center>	<div class="screenshot">		<img src="../gfx/modern.gif"><br>		<p>Figure 3: Modern sequencing method.</p>	<div>	</center>		<br>		<p class="main-text">		Text adapted from a document originally published at: <a href="http://www.uweb.ucsb.edu/~trevorc/">http://www.uweb.ucsb.edu/~trevorc/</a><br>	</p>		<br>		<table border="0" width="100%">		<tr> 			<td bgcolor="#c0c0c0" height="3"></td>		</tr>	</table>	<br>	<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="100%" class="menu">		<tr>			<td><center><a href="quickstart.html"><font size="2">Quick start</font></a></center></td>			<td><center><a href="main.html"><font size="2">Main Window</font></a></center></td>			<td><center><a href="file.html"><font size="2">File Menu</font></a></center></td>			<td><center><a href="edit.html"><font size="2">Edit Menu</font></a></center></td>			<td><center><a href="plugins.html"><font size="2">Plugins</font></a></center></td>		</tr>		<tr>			<td><center><a href="sequencing.html"><font size="2">Sequencing</font></a></center></td>			<td><center><a href="troubles.html"><font size="2">Troubleshooting</font></a></center></td>			<td class="current"><center><a href="history.html"><font size="2">Sequencing History</font></a></center></td>			<td><center><a href="nucleobytes.html"><font size="2">About Nucleobytes</font></a></center></td>			<td></td>		</tr>	</table>		<br><!-- AppleSegEnd --></body></html>
